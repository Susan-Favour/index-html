 <h1 style="color:black;">A Warm Welcome To AkiraChix</h1>
 <h2>My First Week</h2>
 <p>My first week at AkiraChix has been a blissful experience and I have felt beyond welcomed ever since I entered these gates.To feel at home when not at home is such an underrated feeling and I am glad that I got 
    the opportunity to be selected to be here.</p>

 <h3 style="color:black;">Some of the good things I have experienced</h3><ol><li>Good food</li><li>Peaceful environment</li><li>Diversified family</li><li>Supportive Staff</li> </ol>
 <p>Of course perfection does not exist so it would be a lie to say that some things haven't been well for me. However, I must note that it is very minimal and quite franky, beyond the institutions control.
    For instance;<ul><li>The constant nagging of some girls</li><li>Unecessary noise at odd hours</li><li>The dragging of duties</li></ul> </p>
<p>In spite of these reasons, I am still motivated, receptive and optimistic of this new journey.</p> 
 <h4>"Excellence Is Not An Option, It Is The Only Option"</h4>
 This is the best quote I have heard at AkiraChix as its application is not just limited to my stay here, but also beyond.
